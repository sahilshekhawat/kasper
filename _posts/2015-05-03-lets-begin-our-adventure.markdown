Lets get the introduction out of our way first. I am Sahil Shekhawat, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I am **Google Summer of Code** intern at [PyDy](http://www.pydy.org/) and have worked with [Backpack](https://www.usebackpack.com/about) for about one year. Thats pretty much it!

This blog is intented to be a medium of sharing my experiences in programming. I hope that we will learn while having fun. Cheers!
