Finally, I got selected into Google Summer of Code!. I'll be working to create an interactive system generator for [Pydy](http://pydy.org) which is participating under Python Software Foundation. 

Pydy, short of Python Dynamics, is a toolkit written in Python that utilizes many scientific programs to study MultiBody systems. 

My project is to create a web based GUI which adds an abstraction layer over PyDy and lets its users create MultiBody systems interactively. My initial plans can be found [here](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/wiki/GSOC-2015-Application%3A-Sahil-Shekhawat-(Interactive-Generation-of-a-System)) and my weekly progress and updates will be posted here as blog posts.

This is a big project and I can't wait to get started.
