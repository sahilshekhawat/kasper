The goal of PyDy is to have a modular framework and eventually a physics abstraction layer which utilizes a variety of backends. This project will advance PyDy towards it by improving the abstraction layer and creating GUI tools for users. I am calling this module "PyDy-InGen". :) This week I had a meeting with Tarun, one of my mentors and we decided the I should work on a more detailed timeline and list down the exact interface for the API.

I think that the API should be similar to other tools that exist today, this will not only help new users but it will also unify those tools in terms of usage since PYDy wants to extend by utilizing a variety of backends. One of such tool is [Simbody](https://github.com/simbody/simbody). So, my aim will be to build a similar interface. You can find my planned interface on [PyDy's Wiki](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/wiki/GSOC-2015-Application:-Sahil-Shekhawat-(Interactive-Generation-of-a-System)#aim)

About a more detailed timeline, I have not started on work on it since I first want to get a good grasp of what it will be like and how it will connect to PyDy and SymPy, only after that I can come up with a precise timeline. That should be done by 18th May, 2015.

Now-a-days, I am working on some bug fixes and getting myself familiar with the core of Pydy. I am really excited to start work.
