Gsoc is close to the end and just one week is remaining. Soft pencil down date has passed and I, too, have finished all of the main implementation of Body, Abstract Joint, PinJoint, SlidingJoint, CylindricalJoint, PlanarJoint, SphericalJoint and JointMethod classes. I have raise the PRs for all of the classes.

Now I am polishing the implementation, writing unit tests and fixing docstring. Jason and Oliver are helping me in reviewing and we want to get those PRs merged before hard pencil down. i.e. 21st August. I have to write some docs explaining the entire API in general.

Thank you,
Sahil
