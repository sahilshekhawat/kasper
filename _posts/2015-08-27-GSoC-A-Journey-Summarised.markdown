GSoC ended on 21st and final evaluation ends tomorrow. This may look like an end but I can assure you its not. GSoC celebrates the spirit of open source and give an opportunity to be a part of it. Honestly, I started contributing after I got to know about GSoC. My seniors at the college were already doing it. That was enough to get me started.

Fast forward one and a half year, I am here writing this blog post and I know how wrong I was but then thats the whole point. TO GET YOU STARTED and fortunately I did. I saw new people contributing every single day. Sadly, I saw some people leave as well but Man! its a roller coster ride. 

Coming back to my GSoC experience, I spent most of the first half working on the release and discussing the API design with my mentors. I have experience in Javascript and thus, I was able to quickly fix bugs and push code. It was all nice until I started my API design. I knew dynamics was not my forte but I thought how much time it can take. Well, a lot. There came a time when my mentors thought that I will not be able to make it. I was stuck, many times but they always helped me out. Specially Jason, even he is usually super busy but he always helped me and not only just getting me out of the issue that I was having but getting me in the right mood. They made sure that I am enjoying whatever I am doing. No matter what and that what the spirit of open source is. No one contributes because they have to, they do because they enjoy doing it and I should too because its such a nice thing. 

Even after having some pretty big hiccups, we did it. I have Body class merged. Joints and JointsMethod is in a PR and we are working on getting them merged as soon as possible. Last week I spent some time on the docs but I am focusing on merging other PRs first so that I will not have to change docs significantly. From now, I am planning to start working on the GUI for the API and finish that for the next release. After that PyDy will be pretty solid anyone will be able to use it and I am very excited for that. 

Lastly, its not the end it will never be. I would specially like to thank Jason. I couldn't have asked for more from you. :)
